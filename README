Developmental Procedure

We figured out how to use the function getopt() first. After that we wrote the option processing part, optproc.c and optproc.h. Next we wrote the part of processing a single file of a process, readfile.c and readfile.h. We then focus on the usage of readdir() and successfully got the information of the proc directory. The main function was wrote afterwards and we finished the project.
